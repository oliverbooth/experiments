# Experiments

This repository contains various experiments and prototypes that I've developed over time. These generally entail nothing more than a ton of benchmarks, and a few various tests of language and framework features, and for the most part are not really usable in any way.

Alas, I've made this repository open source and added any and all "fuck around and find out" projects I've written over the years. Maybe it'll help people learn something new.

All the experiments have been rewritten for .NET 8 with C# 12 language features, so they should compile and run on the latest version of Roslyn. Have fun!
